# handwritten_digits_knn_mlp_svm

<p>
In this project models based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN) and models based on neural networks of type multi layer perceptron (MLP) are developed and applied to the     
<a href="  https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_digits.html">digits dataset (classification)</a>. Each datapoint is a 8x8 image of a digit. The goal is to recognize the images of the hand-written digits.
</p> 

<p>
The models are evaluated with the accuracy-metric.
</p> 

<p>
Some of techniques applied here are:
</p> 

 <ul>
  <li>data visualization</li>
  <li>train-test-splits</li>
  <li>KFold cross-validation</li>
  <li>Feedforward neural network</li>
  <li>KNeighborsClassifier</li>
  <li>multi layer perceptron classifiers (MLPClassifier)</li>
  <li>hyperparameter tuning</li>
  <li>scaling</li> 
  <li>support vector machines</li>
    
    
</ul>
